# notary service, so Gatekeeper opens it without the "unverified developer"
# warning. Run in CI: once on the app (before packaging) and once on the DMG.
#
# Credentials come from the environment (CI secrets):
#   NOTARY_API_KEY_P8   base64 of the App Store Connect API key (.p8)
#   NOTARY_KEY_ID       the key's ID
#   NOTARY_ISSUER_ID    the issuer UUID
#
# When the credentials are absent it skips quietly (exit 0), so a plain build
# without notarization still succeeds.
